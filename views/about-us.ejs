<h1>About us</h1>
	
<div class="content-box">

<h3>Who are we ?</h3>
	Since you are on the About us page, we have to introduce ourselves.<br>
	So...<b>Hello, we are a friendly tradecryptexchange.com team.</b><br>
	<p class="pt-4">It makes no sense to introduce a whole team of techies, designers and analysts, you can only be a director.<br> <b>Is that ok?</b>Well, if it is, then an introductory word from our founder</p>	
	<blockquote class="mb-30">
		The idea of ​​creating the tradecryptexchange.com project originated in 2017 when the cryptocurrency market was especially volatile. High volatility made me think about arbitrage deals. These transactions were supposed to be super-fast, and as we know, transferring funds to the exchange and between them takes a lot of time. Then I remembered the strategy of "Triangular (triple) arbitrage." This strategy can be used within the framework of 1 exchange and carry out fast transactions via API. I called my school friend, who at that time was already a successful developer, and I asked him to write a small test app for one of the exchanges leading at that time. In 3 hours I had a raw version of the trading bot, which worked almost as I wanted it to.		<p>
		There were fails, stuttering, belated orders, but this was only a draft version. Soon we hired analysts for training the bot to work in emergency situations - PUMP / DUMP - you can earn the most from them with triple arbitrage trading. By that time, my friend (who was a developer) had already made an almost full-fledged bot, and we started making money and still do.		</p>

		<p><b>The idea originated in 2017, so why the platform was launched in 2020?</b></p>
		<p>
			The thing is that volatility has decreased since 2017, the bear market prevailed. In 2018, we had to upgrade the bot to a bear market and quick liquidation. Until mid-2018, we were still making edits and training the trading bot for our arbitrage. In early January 2019, we realized that the bot works perfectly with different movements, force majeure is excluded, so we decided to open our own company. We hired lawyers, marketing experts, and decided to adhere to the basic principles of the Internet company (anonymity and security for users). But again, the business stopped, lawyers said that we should adhere to the KYC and AML policies, which we categorically could not allow because we care about decentralization, anonymity and user safety. After all, KYC and AML did not protect a single exchange user from “exit-scam”, but only limited the possibilities of the sites and prevented the injection of money. I dare to assume there is “exit-scam” in famous exchanges, of course, not including force majeure circumstances like hacker atacks. We began to prepare documents, consult, and in October 2019, we officially registered our company under Hong Kong jurisdiction. A few months took to develop the platform and connect our trading bots, and now ... the platform was launched in the middle of April 2020.		</p>

		<p><b>How did we open a company without KYC / AML?</b></p>
		<p>
			We work with leading analytical companies that track dark and gray transactions. As soon as such funds get into our system, we temporarily block our account before the proceedings, while ordinary users can easily withdraw up to 150 BTC per day without passing any verification. Based on the experience of other cryptocurrency companies, this is the best solution for ordinary users.		</p> 

		<p><b>Sorry, forgot to introduce myself</b></p>
		<p>
			My name is Anton, and I am the CEO of tradecryptexchange.com.		</p>
